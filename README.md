To all practical extents and purposes, I consider myself to be a rank beginner to programming.  I learned Basic when I was 6 years old, and the last code I wrote (other than helping some friends with HTML, which didn't feel like it counted) was over 20 years ago.  I feel like I have forgotten more than I ever learned to begin with.  Hopefully, all of my good habits (i.e., elegance, simplicity, clarity, commenting) will come back to me.  After re-arming myself with a modern take on the basics of coding, I plan to start teaching myself Python and Java.  Re-learning C is next on the agenda, with C++ and C# set to follow.
